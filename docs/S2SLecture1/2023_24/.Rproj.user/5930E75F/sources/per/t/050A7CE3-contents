**Question**

A school is considering introducing a reading programme that aims to improve students' reading speeds.  In order to evaluate the programme a teacher takes a random sample of 47 students and the students are given a couple of pages to read and the reading speed (in words/minute) of each student is recorded and stored in a statistical software package in an object called `speed.1`.  After undertaking the reading programme the same students are given an equivalent reading task and their reading speed (in words/minute) is recorded and stored in the same statistical software in an object called `speed.2`.   


```{r data}
n <- 47
speed.1 <-  as.numeric(sample(200:280,n,replace=TRUE))
speed.2 <-  speed.1-rep(30,n)
#speed.2 <- speed.2+sample(15:25,n,replace=TRUE)
speed.2 <- speed.2+round(rnorm(n,mean=29,sd=5),0)
differences <- speed.2-speed.1

reading <- data.frame(speed.1,speed.2,differences)
speed.long <- data.frame(student=c(1:n,1:n),reading.speed=c(speed.1,speed.2),time=c(rep("Before",n),rep("After",n)))
speed.long$time <- factor(speed.long$time,levels=c("Before","After"))
```



(a) The three plots shown in Figures 1-3 were produced to explore the data and inform the analysis but not all the plots are appropriate for this context.

```{r Figures1-3}

boxplot(reading.speed~time,data=speed.long,xlab="",ylab="Reading Speed",main="Figure 1")

ggplot(speed.long, aes(x = time, y = reading.speed, group = student)) + 
geom_line() + 
geom_point(size = 2, aes(color = time)) +
scale_x_discrete("") +
theme_minimal() +
labs(title="Figure 2")+
ylab("Reading Speed")

plot(speed.1,speed.2,main="Figure 3")
abline(a=0,b=1)

#+
# theme(legend.position = "top", 
#       panel.grid = element_blank(),
#       axis.text.x = element_blank(),
#       axis.line.y = element_line(size = .5))

```


(i) Choose one of the plots which is appropriate for these data and explain why it is appropriate.

(ii) Choose one of the plots which is not appropriate  for these data and explain why it is not appropriate.


**ANSWER (a)(i)**

Either 

* Figure 2 (line plot) is appropriate because it shows the 'before' and 'after' reading speeds for each student with paired values joined by lines **OR** 
* Figure 3 (scatterplot) is appropriate because it shows each pair of 'before' and 'after' reading speeds as a point relatively to the line of equality

[1 MARK] for an appropriate plot

[1 MARK] for correct explanation


**ANSWER (a)(ii)**

* Figure 1 (boxplot) is not appropriate because it shows the 'before' and 'after' reading speeds as separate samples and give no indication of the paired nature of the data (i.e. that each student has a 'before' and 'after' reading speed)

[1 MARK] for the inappropriate plot

[1 MARK] for correct explanation


The teacher decides the best way to analyse these data is to first calculate the change in each student's reading speed by calculating a new data object called `differences` by subtracting each student's first reading speed `speed.1` (i.e. before doing the reading programme) from their second reading speed `speed.2` (i.e. after they had done the reading programme).  

(b) State one reason why the teacher decides to proceed in this way?

**ANSWER (b)**

EITHER

- Because the original data are paired  **OR**

- Because the differences are independent 

[1 MARK]

To inform the analysis of the data, the teacher produced the histogram of the difference shown in Figure 4.

```{r Figure4}
hist(x = differences,main="Figure 4")
```

(c) State an assumption about the differences that the histogram could be used to investigate.

**ANSWER (c)**

- The assumption that the differences are from a normal distribution

[1 MARK]


<!-- (???) State a justification for the use of a z-test to analyse this data rather than a t-test. -->

<!-- **ANSWER (???)** -->

<!-- - The sample size is large, i.e. greater than 40, therefore z-test can used instead of t-test even though the population variance of the differences is unknown -->

<!-- [1 MARK] -->



The teacher decides to use a z-test to analyse the differences in reading speeds and  Output 1 contains the results of the z-test performed using statistical software.

```{r OUTPUT1, eval=FALSE}
z.test(x = differences,
       sigma.x = sd(differences),
       mu = 0,
       alternative = "two.sided")
```


**Output 1**

````markdown
`r ''`One-sample z-Test

data:  differences
z = ******, p-value = 0.0414
alternative hypothesis: true mean is not equal to 0
95 percent confidence interval:
 -2.71535261 -0.05060483
sample estimates:
mean of x 
-1.382979 
````




(d) (i) State the hypotheses used in the z-test reported in Output 1.

(ii) Calculate the missing value indicated by ***** in Output 1 using the reported p-value and the standard normal table (Table 3 on page 11 in the Statistical Formulae and Tables booklet).

(iii) Interpret the p-value reported in Output 1 in terms of the context of these data.


**ANSWER (d)(i)**

* The null hypothesis is that the population mean difference is zero
* The alternatve hypothesis is that the population mean difference is not equal to zero 

[1 MARK] for correct null hypothesis

[1 MARK] for correct alternate hypothesis

**ANSWER (d)(ii)**

* A two tailed test is reported so first halve the reported p-value: 0.0414/2 = 0.0207
* The z-score corresponding to this value is the z-score with cumulative probability (as given in the Table 3) of 1-0.0207 = 0.9793
* From Table 3 the z-score is therefore either -2.04 or 2.04 (accept either value)

[3 MARKS] corresponding to the three steps above


**ANSWER (d)(iii)**

* Because the p-value < 0.05 therefor we conclude there is sufficient evidence to reject the null hypothesis and conclude the reading programme has resulted in a statistically significant change in the population mean reading speed of students.

[2 MARKS] for correct conclusion and interpretation



```{r OUTPUT2, eval=FALSE}
print("NOT TO BE INCLUDED")
t.test(differences,
       mu = 0,
       alternative = "two.sided")
```

(e) If instead the researcher wanted to test the hypothesis that the reading speed had got faster after students took the reading programme, state how the test statistic and p-value obtained from this test would compare to the equivalent values reported in Output 1.

**ANSWER (e)**

* The test statistic will be the same as in Output 1

* The p-value will be half the p-value in Output 1

(NB given that the difference is defined as `speed.2`-`speed.1` above)

[1 MARK] for correct statement about the test statistic

[1 MARK] for correct statement about the p-value


```{r one.sided, eval=FALSE}
print("NOT TO BE INCLUDED")
z.test(x = differences,
       sigma.x = sd(differences),
       mu = 0,
       alternative = "less")
```

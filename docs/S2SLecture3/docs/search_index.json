You are invited to consent to your data to be included in an educational research study to evaluate student levels of engagement and teaching styles in Levels 1&amp;2 Statistics courses in the School of Mathematics and Statistics.. To participate you only need to read the Participant Information Sheet and submit your name and student number. Level 2 Stats lecturers and tutors will have no knowledge of who has/hasn't participated in the study. All information and link to give consent is available now on the Level 2 Stats Moodle Page "],["activity.html", "Activity", " Activity Consider a population of 146 university students and the variable “how many drinks does it take to get drunk” shown here: Simulate the sampling distribution of the sample mean as an estimator of the population mean from a simple random sample of size 10. Use R, either via RStudio on your own device or this online console. Estimate the standard error of this point estimate. In order to estimate the average number of drinks it takes these 146 university students to get drunk: Step 1.Take a simple random sample of ten students from the population. sample(1:146,10) Step 2. Create a vector of the number of drinks it takes for the students in the sample to get drunk. values &lt;- c( , , , , , , , , , ) #You need to look up values in the table and insert them Step 3. Calculate your sample mean, sample standard deviation and estimate of the standard error mean(values) sd(values) sd(values)/sqrt(10) Step 4.

Use R, either via RStudio on your own device or this online console. Estimate the standard error of this point estimate. In order to estimate the average number of drinks it takes these 146 university students to get drunk: Step 1.Take a simple random sample of ten students from the population. sample(1:146,10) Step 2. Create a vector of the number of drinks it takes for the students in the sample to get drunk. values &lt;- c( , , , , , , , , , ) #You need to look up values in the table and insert them Step 3. Calculate your sample mean, sample standard deviation and estimate of the standard error mean(values) sd(values) sd(values)/sqrt(10) Step 4.

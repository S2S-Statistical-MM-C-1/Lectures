Today you will be introduced to R and RStudio and learn how to download and install them on to your device. R is a programming language that you will use to write code in numerous statistics courses throughout your degree. RStudio is an accompaniment to R, known as an Integrated Development Environment (IDE). RStudio essentially makes all features of the R programming language easier to use and it is the software you will interact with, rather than R directly. It is best for you to install R and RStudio on your own device and use this throughout your courses. If you do not already have R and RStudio downloaded on your device, follow the steps outlined below in Sections 1.1 and 1.2 before moving on to Section 3 which will detail how to use RStudio. If you are unable to install R or RStudio on to your own device, or are using a tablet, look at section 2 for some alternative ways to use R and RStudio. 1.1 Installing R The first step is to install R onto your device. This can be done for free from CRAN (the Comprehensive R Archive Network). R is available for Windows, Mac OS, Linux and some other less common operating systems. If you are using a Windows device, follow this link and click 'Download R-4.3.1 for Windows' to download the installer for the latest version of R. Once this is complete, run the installer and accept all default settings. If you are using a Mac, follow this link and select the .pkg file from the left of the screen to download the installer for the latest version of R. Make sure to choose the one applicable for the chip your Mac uses (you can check what chip is used by going to ï£¿ &gt; About This Mac). Once the download is complete, open the file and complete the onscreen steps to finish installing R. 1.2 Installing RStudio Now that R is installed on your device, you are ready to download and install RStudio. To do this, follow the link to RStudio and click on the link 'Download RStudio...'. This should automatically detect what system your device is using but make sure to double check it says either for Windows or for MacOS - whichever is correct! This file may take a while to download, but once it has launch the installer and follow the steps to complete the installation. You are now ready to use RStudio. Make sure you launch the RStudio app to work within, rather than R. 1.3 Updating R and RStudio Both R and RStudio are updated occasionally. It is important to use an up-to-date version of both so that everything runs smoothly. If you already have R and RStudio installed on your device, check what version of each you are using in an open RStudio app window. You can find the version of R you are using by running the code below in RStudio (see section 3 to learn how to run code). The first line this shows in the console pane will say something like R version 4.3.1. If the version of R you have installed is below version 4.2.0, then use section 1.1 above to install an updated version (if you are using a Windows device, you might first need to uninstall R before updating it). sessionInfo() You can find the version of RStudio you are using by going to Help &gt; Check for Updates at the very top of the RStudio window. If an update is available, then use section 1.2 above to install an updated version. "],["virtual.html", "2 Accessing RStudio Virtually 2.1 Virtual Desktop 2.2 Posit Cloud", " 2 Accessing RStudio Virtually 2.1 Virtual Desktop If you are unable to download and install RStudio on to your own device, don't worry! It is possible to access RStudio on the University's Virtual Desktop, called Glasgow Anywhere Desktop. To do this, follow this link and select the 'Connect to Glasgow Anywhere Desktop via your web browser' link. You will need to log in using your student email and password and then select the 'Student Desktop'. This will open a Windows desktop in your browser - the same one you would see on a PC in the computer labs. Figure 2.1: Glasgow Anywhere Student Desktop Search for the RStudio app within this desktop and launch it. You will then be able to use RStudio in the same way as if it was installed on your own device. 2.2 Posit Cloud If you are using a tablet, you won't be able to install R and RStudio, however an alternative is to use Posit Cloud. This allows you to use RStudio in a browser. You can create a free account which allows you to use RStudio for 25 hours per month. Because of this limit, we recommend that you only use Posit Cloud to follow along in lectures - in the labs, you can use a lab PC. To use RStudio in Posit Cloud, sign in to your account and navigate to the Posit Cloud page. Figure 2.2: Posit Cloud Homepage To start a new RStudio session, go to New Project &gt; New RStudio Project which will open an RStudio window in your browser. This 'project' will be saved in \"Your Workspace\" so you can return to it for all the lectures. "],["UseR.html", "3 Using RStudio 3.1 Practise Code", " 3 Using RStudio Open the RStudio app and create a new text file (called an \"R script\") by: clicking '' in the top left of the RStudio window selecting ' R Script' from the drop down menu options This will open a new pane in the RStudio window which is where you will write all of your code. RStudio is arranged with four panes, the default layout of which you can see below. Figure 3.1: RStudio window This is the source pane. This is where you will view, write and edit all your code and view data in a spreadsheet format. Typically this pane isn't displayed when you first launch RStudio; instead, you need to open a new (or pre-existing) R script or load in some data. We 'run' code from here by selecting the row(s) we want to execute and clicking the ' Run' icon in the top right of this pane (alternatively hold the ctrl key (or cmd on Mac) and hit enter at the same time). This is the console pane. This is where you can view the outcome of any code you have 'run', as well as type in commands and view output messages such as warnings or errors from code that doesn't work correctly. This pane has several different tabs, but the most used one is the Environment tab. This lists some information about the 'objects' you have created in your code, such as data frames, vectors or statistical models which we'll learn more about throughout these labs. This pane also has several tabs. The ones of note here are the Files tab which shows the folders and files the current RStudio session has access to; the Plots tab which shows any plots or graphs you have created in your code; and the Help tab which can be used to learn more about the properties of different functions that can be used in R Studio. 3.1 Practise Code To test that your RStudio is working as expected, copy and paste the following code to the R Script you have just created. You can then 'run' this code to see the result. (112/8)*0.5 You should see the value 7 pasted in the console pane. It is also good to know that you can use \"packages\" in R. To install the package ggplot2 on to your device, copy and paste the code below into your R script, then make sure to run these two lines. install.packages(&quot;ggplot2&quot;) library(ggplot2) The ggplot2 package is used to create graphs and plots in R Studio. Again, copy and paste the code below then run it to see an example of a plot you can create in R. You don't need to understand any of this code at the moment, it will all be explained in your courses! ggplot(data = mtcars) + geom_boxplot(aes(x = as.factor(cyl), y = mpg), fill = &quot;slateblue&quot;, alpha = 0.2) + xlab(&quot;cyl&quot;) Now you should see the following plot in the plots tab. To save an R script with any code you have written, simply click the '' icon at the top left of the source pane and choose where to save the file (make sure this is somewhere you can find it again!). R scripts are saved as .r files. To open a previously saved R script, either click on the .r file in the folder you've saved it to, or within RStudio go to File &gt; Open File... and choose the .r file from there. Now that you have RStudio installed and know everything works as expected, you can run the following code to play a game of Wordle in the console pane! install.packages(&quot;wordler&quot;) library(wordler) play_wordler() "],["404.html", "Page not found", " Page not found The page you requested cannot be found (perhaps it was moved or renamed).

**Do you think the the sampling distribution of $\bar X$, when samples of size $n=2$ are taken from the $\mbox{Unif}(-11,\,41)$ distribution, is approximately normal?**

`r longmcq(c(answer = "Yes", "No", "Can't say"))`


**If we were to take samples of size $n=2$ from the $\mbox{Unif}(-11,\, 41)$ distribution, what distribution would $\bar X$ follow, according to the Central Limit Theorem?**

```{r, echo=FALSE}
opts1 <- sample(c(answer = "$N\\Big(15,\\textstyle\\frac{15}{\\sqrt{2}}\\Big)$",
           "$N\\Big(-11,\\textstyle\\frac{41}{\\sqrt{2}}\\Big)$",
           "$N\\Big(15,15\\Big)$",
           "$\\mbox{Unif}\\Big(-11,41\\Big)$"), size = 4)
```

`r longmcq(opts1)`

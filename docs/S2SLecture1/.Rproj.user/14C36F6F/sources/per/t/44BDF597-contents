* See the Textbook information in the **Textbook** section on the S2S Moodle page
* Be sure to do the pre-lecture reading for each lecture to get the most out of the lectures.
* It's the pre-lecture reading material that's examinable, not just the lecture material
* Post questions in advance that you'd like answered in the lecture in ["Your questions for lectures"](https://moodle.gla.ac.uk/mod/feedback/view.php?id=4075572) on Moodle.
<!-- * All the pre-lecture reading and links are on **S2S Moodle page**. -->
<!-- * We may use Mentimeter to gather class responses during lectures via [menti.com](https://www.menti.com/). -->

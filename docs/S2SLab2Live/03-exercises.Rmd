## Exercise 1 {-}

Table \@ref(tab:temptable) below shows the annual mean temperature (in degrees Celsius) at 4 different locations along the River Dee for each year from 2015 to 2021. These data have been collected under the Scotland River Temperature Monitoring Network (SRTMN) project.

```{r temptable-setup, echo=FALSE}
temp.data <- c(NA,6.83,7.01,7.03,6.88,7.06,7.28,5.79,6.00,6.25,6.23,6.13,6.25,6.48,5.77,6.28,6.53,6.81,6.36,6.55,6.59,6.14,6.65,6.83,7.07,6.58,6.86,6.92)
years <- c("2015", "2016", "2017", "2018", "2019", "2020", "2021")
sites <- c("Site 1", "Site 2", "Site 3", "Site 4")

temp.table <- matrix(temp.data, ncol=7, byrow=TRUE)
dimnames(temp.table) <- list(sites, years)

# https://data.marine.gov.scot/dataset/scotland-river-temperature-monitoring-network-summary-data-0
```

```{r temptable, echo=FALSE}
library(knitr)
kable(temp.table, caption="Recorded annual mean temperatures across the River Dee in the years 2015 to 2021.")
```

Save these data in a matrix called `temps` and make sure to rename the rows and columns of this matrix so they match the row and column names shown in Table \@ref(tab:temptable).

Calculate the mean of all the temperatures from Site 3 across all seven years.

Calculate the mean of the temperatures across all four sites in 2015.


## Exercise 2 {-}

Make sure the package `PASWR2` is installed and loaded in your current RStudio session. From this package, save the data frame `SWIMTIMES` into your **Environment** tab. This data set gives the improvement time (in seconds) for 28 swimmers who were randomly assigned to one of two different diets (see more by running the code `help("SWIMTIMES")`).

Explore the structure of the variables of this data set and change the labels for the levels of the factor `diet` to be `high` and `low`.

What is the mean improvement time for swimmers who were on a high fat diet?


## Exercise 3 {-}

Mercedes has decided to keep track of different aspects of their life. Below are their notes recording their daily steps, some of their expenses and their most recent exam results.

```{r notes-image, echo=FALSE}
include_graphics("Images/notes.png")
```

Create three separate data frames, one for each of these notes, that stores the information shown above. Call them `steps`, `expenses` and `grades` respectively.

Then, combine these data frames into a single list so that Mercedes can easily continue to track these parts of their life.

Can you write code to show only the expenses from 14/08, using the list you have created?
